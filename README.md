# FIZZBUZZ
## Classic Fizz Buzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

ex output:
```sh
1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz
```
## Goal
We'll be slightly modifying FizzBuzz to build a more flexible program. The key difference is our FizzBuzz will accepts five parameters : three integers int1, int2 and limit, and two strings str1 and str2, allowing for any range of numbers we wish.
